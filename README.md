# Vitality-GOSH_FHIRworks_Hackathon_2020

Vitality is an open-source wearable web application for the Galaxy smart watch. It uses the Galaxy smart watch's built in
HRM to measure the user's heart rate, stores its 'observations' on the watch and securely uploads them as FHIR records to 
the gosh azure FHIR server implementation. The application is built on top of the Tizen Advanced UI Framework (TAU) which
facilitates the efficient creation and management of various kinds of UI components.
